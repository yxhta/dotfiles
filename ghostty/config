# --- Core Behavior ---
# Disable native fullscreen to use the current screen space (faster transition)
# macos-non-native-fullscreen = true

# Treat the Option key as Alt (Useful for Vim/Emacs users)
macos-option-as-alt = true

# Hide the mouse cursor while typing (Must be boolean)
mouse-hide-while-typing = true

# Clipboard control (Sync with OS clipboard)
clipboard-read = allow
clipboard-write = allow

# --- Visuals & Theme ---
# Background opacity (Replaces alpha-blending)
# 0.9 to 0.95 provides a good balance of readability and aesthetics.
# background-opacity = 0.95

# Blur effect (Recommended for a native macOS feel)
background-blur-radius = 20

# Window padding (Improves readability near edges)
window-padding-x = 10
window-padding-y = 10
window-padding-balance = true

# Cursor appearance
cursor-color = "#c0c0c0"
cursor-style = block
cursor-style-blink = true
shell-integration-features = no-cursor

# Color theme
# theme = "Kanagawa Wave"
# theme = "Kanagawa Dragon"
theme = "Kanagawabones"

# --- Font Configuration ---
# Primary font
font-family = "Lilex"
# Fallback font (Handles glyphs missing in Lilex, e.g., CJK characters)
font-family = "HackGen"

# Default font size (Adjust according to your environment)
font-size = 14

# Ligature control
# -dlig: Disable Discretionary Ligatures
font-feature = "-dlig"

# --- Keybindings (Splits) ---
# Ghostty native screen splitting.
# Since chorded keys (like Tmux's 'Ctrl+s -> ...') are not natively supported,
# using the Cmd (Super) key is the recommended best practice.

# Cmd + D to split right
keybind = super+d=new_split:right

# Cmd + Shift + D to split down
keybind = super+shift+d=new_split:down

# Navigate between splits (Cmd + Arrow keys)
keybind = super+left=goto_split:left
keybind = super+right=goto_split:right
keybind = super+up=goto_split:top
keybind = super+down=goto_split:bottom

# Toggle split zoom (Maximize current pane)
keybind = super+z=toggle_split_zoom
